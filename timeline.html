                                                        <p>A number of ministers and their congregations secede from the the state-sanctioned church in the Netherlands. Albertus Van Raalte is among them. The fscheiding (or “separation”) has begun and many Dutch Christians will leave the Hervormde Kerk n the following years as it becomes more liberal. This conflict also sowed seeds of disagreement that were brought to America.

           <h4>The Schism and Culture </h4> 

This timeline tells the story of the religious life of dutch migrants from their arrival in America to joining the RCA to the schisms that formed the CRC. However, their Dutch identify and cultural factors are closely linked to their religious life. Religious groups produce distinctive cultures and worldviews. Culture is defined as “the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time.” [1] When Dutch settlers came to Holland, MI to flee religious persecution in the Netherlands, they also brought a certain culture - one that was very different from the American culture surrounding them. Separatist attitudes, the protection of orthodox purity, and the desire to preserve Dutch identity and culture were three factors that played a huge role in the experience of these migrants, including the secession of the Christian Reformed Church (CRC) out of the Reformed Church of America (RCA). [2] Minor differences today still cause these two denominations to stay separated. However, most members today of the RCA and CRC cannot specifically explain most of the differences that exist and want the two denominations to work more closely together. [3]

<h4>Secularization Theory</h4>

Two theories, secularization theory and modernization theory, are crucial for understanding the separatist attitude that many in the Dutch Reformed churches brought to America. [4] Both the RCA and CRC were responding to secularization. Secularization theory is rooted in modernization theory which “posits that modern societies stand in stark contrast to traditional societies,” and these differences largely affect people. [5] Modernization erodes religious commitment because of increased industrialization, urbanization, technology advancements, advanced education, etc. [6] Secularization has resulted in a decline of religious involvement, an increase in modernization, and a decrease in the ability religion has to influence public society. There are two responses available then to religious communities dealing with secularization: accommodation to culture or resistance to culture. It was in this choice that the RCA and CRC differed.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>

The RCA and CRC have similar heritage, liturgy, and culture. However, the CRC has historically placed greater emphasis on doctrinal purity and the RCA has been more focused on church unity. [7] The CRC broke off from the RCA due to concerns that the RCA was not theologically pure after becoming "Americanized." Yet overall, the nineteenth-century secession was not based solely on theological differences; there were many cultural factors that played a role in the schism. [8] As will be demonstrated in the timeline, both church denominations shared a common heritage and background.  However, differences in theology and doctrinal purity, in the face of cultural change, ultimately resulted in a denominational schism between the two.</p>
